## Project Overvieww

In the era of endless streaming content, users are overwhelmed by choices. This project delivers an advanced, production-ready movie recommendation system using the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset. The system combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) to provide highly accurate, personalized movie recommendations. An interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) web app enables users to explore recommendations, analytics, and model performance.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Recommendation Approaches:**
  - Content-based filtering (genres, tags)
  - User-based and item-based collaborative filtering
  - SVD-based matrix factorization
  - Hybrid and ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
- **Streamlit Web App:**
  - Interactive UI for recommendations, analytics, and model performance
  - Visualizations: rating distributions, genre popularity, user activity, model comparisons
  - A/B testing simulator for business impact analysis
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:**
  - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, Precision@K, Recall@K, MAP, NDCG
  - Business-focused insights for deployment and user engagement

## Data Description

- **Source:** [MovieLens ml-latest-small](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
- **Size:** 100,836 ratings, 3,683 tags, 9,742 movies, 610 users
- **Files:**
  - `movies.csv`: Movie metadata (title, genres)
  - `ratings.csv`: User ratings (userId, movieId, rating, timestamp)
  - `tags.csv`: User-generated tags
  - `links.csv`: External links to IMDb and TMDb
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Merging, cleaning, and feature engineering (genres, tags, user/movie stats)
  - Removal of users/movies with <5 ratings to reduce sparsity
  - One-hot encoding, normalization, and timestamp conversion

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load and merge MovieLens data files
   - Clean missing values, engineer features (genres, tags, user/movie stats)
   - Normalize ratings, reduce sparsity
2. **Model Development:**
   - Content-based filtering (TF-IDF + Nearest Neighbors)
   - User-based and item-based collaborative filtering
   - SVD-based matrix factorization
   - Advanced ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
   - Hybrid and stacking approaches
3. **Evaluation:**
   - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, Precision@K, Recall@K, MAP, NDCG
   - Business impact: A/B testing simulator, engagement metrics
